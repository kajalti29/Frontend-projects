Id attribute:- The id attribute is used to uniquely identify a single element on a webpage.
A page should not have multiple elements with the same id.

Every student has a roll number → That is like an id (unique).
<h1 id="title">Hello</h1>

Class attribute :- The class attribute is used to group multiple elements together so that they can share the same styling or behavior.
Imagine a classroom 👩‍🏫

<p class="text">Para1</p>
<p class="text">Para2</p>
